            Trigger results are computed by first calculating the rejection rates of vehicles where there is no voltage present during testing.  
            Station-specific trigger index scores are then calculated for each station by using an algorithm that compares the station’s performance 
            to that of other stations in the network, as shown below:
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            Index score = (station rate / highest rate) x 100
        </span><span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            Using this algorithm, stations that have a 0% no voltage rate reflect the lowest rejection test result percentages that were caused by a lack of voltage.  
            The station(s) with the highest no voltage rate represent the highest rejection test result percentages that have no voltage.

            Trigger results are grouped in deciles based on their index scores (0 = 0 to less than 10, 1 = 10 to less than 20, …, 9 = 90 to 100) for ease of presentation. 
             Users can view the decile results in several forms (pie, bar, line, area or spline).  Those deciles that do not contain any results (e.g., decile 3 if no 
            stations had index scores of 30 to less than 40) are not displayed.  
        </span>

        <span>
            Viewing the graphic results in bar chart form allows a user to quickly see the overall distribution of trigger results throughout the network.  
        For example, a bar chart that shows almost all stations in the zero decile reflects very good (proper) network performance on that trigger.  
        One with a substantial fraction of stations in the high deciles may be evidence of wider-spread performance problems.  However, this would not be true 
        if the worst no voltage rate is actually very low.

            User can also click on the individual bars to see a listing of trigger results for each of the stations making up that bar.
            This brings up a table that shows the underlying data—total test count, voltage, voltage percent, no voltage, and no voltage percentage.  
            The table contents can be sorted by any of the column headings by clicking on that heading.

            Because of the small number of stations in some of the deciles, it is not possible to click on those bars to bring up the list of stations.  
            Users can instead display the results in pie chart form and click on either the applicable slice or the title of the slice.  
            This allows a user to bring up the station results for all deciles displayed in the charts.
