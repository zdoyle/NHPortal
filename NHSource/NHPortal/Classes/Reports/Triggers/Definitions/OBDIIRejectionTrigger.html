            Trigger results are computed by calculating the amount of tests that have failed OBDII and comparing these results with the total amount of tests performed.  
            The results of this comparison are used to calculate a “rejection” rate in % for each inspection station.  
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            Trigger index scores are then calculated for each station by using an algorithm that compares the station’s performance to that of other stations 
            in the inspection network, as shown below:
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            Index score = (station rate / highest rate) x 100
        </span><span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            Using this algorithm, stations that have a 0% rejection rate would have a score of 100, which reflects lower rejection percentage on the OBDII test.  
            The station(s) with the highest rejection rate would have a score of 0, which reflects a higher rejection percentage on the OBDII test.

            Trigger results are grouped in deciles based on their index scores (0 = 0 to less than 10, 1 = 10 to less than 20, …, 9 = 90 to 100) for ease of presentation.  
            Users can view the decile results in several forms (pie, bar, line, area or spline).  Those deciles that do not contain any results (e.g., decile 3 if
             no stations had index scores of 30 to less than 40) are not displayed.  
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            Viewing the graphic results in bar chart form allows a user to quickly see the overall distribution of trigger results throughout the network.  
        For example, a bar chart that shows almost all stations in the zero decile reflects very good (proper) network performance on that trigger.  
        One with a substantial fraction of stations in the high deciles may be evidence of wider-spread performance problems. 
         However, this would not be true if the worst rejection rate is actually very low.

        <span>
            User can also click on the individual bars to see a listing of trigger results for each of the stations making up that bar.  
            This brings up a table that shows the underlying data—total test count, rejection count, and rejection percent.  
            The table contents can be sorted by any of the column headings by clicking on that heading.

            Because of the small number of stations in some of the deciles, it is not possible to click on those bars to bring up the list of stations.  
            Users can instead display the results in pie chart form and click on either the applicable slice or the title of the slice.  
            This allows a user to bring up the station results for all deciles displayed in the charts.
