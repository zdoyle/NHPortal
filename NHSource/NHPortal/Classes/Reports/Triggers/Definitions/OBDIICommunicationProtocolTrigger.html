            Trigger results are computed by first comparing the communication protocol recorded for each test vehicle as 
            part of their OBDII inspection to a VIN stem-based master (truth) table of proper communication protocols.  
            The results of this comparison are used to calculate a “no-match” rate in % for each inspection station between 
            recorded results and the contents of the truth table.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
                 Trigger index scores are then calculated for each station by using an algorithm that compares the station’s 
            performance to that of other stations in the inspection network, as shown below:
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            Index score = [(highest no-match rate – station rate) / highest rate] x 100
        </span><span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            Using this algorithm, stations that have a 0% no-match rate would have a score of 100, which reflects a perfect record 
            of proper communications on the OBDII test.  The station(s) with the highest no-match rate would have a score of 0, 
            which reflects the worst degree of improper OBDII communications (i.e., likely clean scanning) across the entire network.  
            Other stations will be distributed along the 0-100 index scale, with lower scores reflecting a greater incidence of suspected clean scanning.

            Trigger results are grouped in deciles based on their index scores (0 = 0 to less than 10, 1 = 10 to less than 20, …, 9 = 90 to 100) for ease of presentation.  
            Users can view the decile results in several forms (pie, bar, line, area or spline).  Those deciles that do not contain any results (e.g., decile 3 if no stations 
            had index scores of 30 to less than 40) are not displayed.

            Viewing the graphic results in bar chart form allows a user to quickly see the overall distribution of trigger results throughout the network.  
            For example, a bar chart that shows almost all stations in the ninth decile reflects very good (proper) network performance on that trigger.  
            One with a substantial fraction of stations in the lower deciles may be evidence of wider-spread performance problems.  However, this would not be true 
            if the worst no-match rate is actually very low.

        <span>
            User can also click on the individual bars to see a listing of trigger results for each of the stations making up that bar.  
            This brings up a table that shows the underlying data—total test count and number of matches, no matches and unknowns 
            (the latter reflects those vehicles which do not have a proper communications protocol listed in the truth table)—as well as the computed match, 
            no-match and unknown rates for each station.  The table contents can be sorted by any of the column headings by clicking on that heading.

            Because of the small number of stations in some of the deciles, it is not possible to click on those bars to bring up the list of stations.  
            Users can instead display the results in pie chart form and click on either the applicable slice or the title of the slice.  
            This allows a user to bring up the station results for all deciles displayed in the charts.
