            Trigger results are computed by first comparing the eVIN (when reported*) for a
            tested vehicle as part of their OBDII inspection to the VIN entered at the
            beginning of the inspection procedure. The results of this comparison are used
            to calculate a “no-match” rate in % for each inspection station between reported
            eVINs and the entered VINs.

            *<i>
                If the OBD VIN field in an inspection is
                NULL and the model year is equal to or greater than 2005, then the VID data will
                be searched for a record matching the entered VIN. If a matching record is found
                with a reported OBD VIN, the record with the NULL OBD VIN field will be included
                in the calculation for eVIN triggers
            </i>.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            Trigger index scores are then calculated for each station by using an algorithm
            that compares the station’s performance to that of other stations in the
            inspection network, as shown below:
        </span><span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            <span>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </span>Index score = [(highest no-match rate – station rate) / highest rate] x
            100
        </span><span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            &nbsp;Using this algorithm, stations that have a 0% no-match rate would have a score
            of 100, which reflects a perfect record of properly entered VINs.<span>
                &nbsp;
            </span>The station(s) with the highest no-match rate would have a score of 0,
            which reflects the worst degree of improperly entered VINs (indicating a high
            likelihood of clean scanning) across the entire network.<span>
                &nbsp;
            </span>Other stations will be distributed along the 0-100 index scale, with
            lower scores reflecting a greater incidence of suspected clean scanning.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            There is an additional option available in the calculation of this trigger. The
            user has the ability to calculate the trigger % only when the reported VIN
            passes a check digit check. Limiting the trigger results by this option is
            available to the user by checking the ‘Omit Invalid OBD VINs’ box that is
            located on the Initial Data Entry screen. The default method for calculation of
            the eVIN trigger will be to include all reported OBD VINs regardless of the
            check digit accuracy.

            Trigger results are grouped in deciles based on their index scores (0 = 0 to
            less than 10, 1 = 10 to less than 20, …, 9 = 90 to 100) for ease of
            presentation.<span>&nbsp; </span>Users can view the
            decile results in several forms (pie, bar, line, area or spline).<span>
                &nbsp;
            </span>Those deciles that do not contain any results (e.g., decile 3 if no
            stations had index scores of 30 to less than 40) are not displayed.<span>

        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            Viewing the graphic results in bar chart form allows a user to quickly see the
            overall distribution of trigger results throughout the network.<span>
                &nbsp;
            </span>For example, a bar chart that shows almost all stations in the ninth
            decile reflects very good (proper) network performance on that trigger.<span>
                &nbsp;
            </span>One with a substantial fraction of stations in the lower deciles may be
            evidence of wider-spread performance problems.<span>
                &nbsp;
            </span>However, this would not be true if the worst no-match rate is actually
            very low.

        <span>
            User can also click on the individual bars to see a listing of trigger results
            for each of the stations making up that bar.<span>
                &nbsp;
            </span>This brings up a table that shows the underlying data—total test count
            and number of matches, no matches and unknowns (the latter reflects those
            vehicles which do not have a reported EVIN)—as well as the computed match,
            no-match and unknown rates for each station.<span>
                &nbsp;
            </span>The table contents can be sorted by any of the column headings by
            clicking on that heading.<span>&nbsp; </span>

            Because of the small number of stations in some of the deciles, it is not
            possible to click on those bars to bring up the list of stations.<span>
                &nbsp;
            </span>Users can instead display the results in pie chart form and click on
            either the applicable slice or the title of the slice.<span>
                &nbsp;
            </span>This allows a user to bring up the station results for all deciles
            displayed in the charts.

            After clicking on the chart bar (or slice, if pie chart is used) to open a
            decile, the user is presented with the list of the stations in that decile. On
            the left side of that list will be a red “Details” box for each station. To view
            a station’s details click on the red “Details” button. This will present the
            Detail Trigger IQ section where you can determine the level of detail you want
            to retrieve by checking the Info boxes at the top of the screen.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            The detailed info that will be retrieved depends on which Info boxes you check.
            Trigger information will always be displayed regardless of which Info boxes you
            check or if you don’t check any of the Info boxes.

            The detail inspection results returned for eVIN triggers should be interpreted
            this way:
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            When a mismatch between the entered VIN and the OBD VIN exists; the entered VIN
            field will be
            <span class="red-cell">RED</span> with white font and the OBD VIN field will be
            <span class="blue-cell">BLUE</span> with white font. In a case where the OBD VIN field is NULL and the
            model year is equal to or greater than 2005 and an OBD VIN was reported in
            another inspection, the blank eVIN field will be
            <span class="blue-cell">BLUE</span>
            and the Model Year field will be
            <span class="red-cell">RED</span>
            with white font. Records marked with these colored fields indicate
            possible clean scanned inspections based upon eVIN reporting.
