            Trigger results are computed by first calculating rejection rates on the vehicle safety inspection by model year for each inspection station.  
            Model-year-specific trigger index scores are then calculated for each station using an algorithm that compares the station’s performance to that 
            of other stations in the inspection network, as shown below:
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            Index score =    [(station rejection rate – lowest rejection rate) / (highest rejection rate – lowest rejection rate] x 100
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            The highest and lowest rejection rates shown in the algorithm are network-wide values; e.g., the highest rate would be the maximum rejection 
            rate for a model year recorded for a model year during the analysis period at any single station in the network. 
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            The station(s) with the highest model-year-specific rejection rate would have a score of 100 for that model year, while the station(s) with 
            the lowest rejection rate would have a score of 0.  Other stations will be distributed along the 0-100 index scale, depending on how their 
            rejection rates compare to the recorded maximum and minimum values.  The calculated model-year-specific index scores are then averaged to 
            compute an overall index score for each station.  Model years or stations with too small test volumes to be considered statistically valid
             are excluded from the calculation to avoid invalid results.  
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            It is presumed that stations with high index scores are properly inspecting and rejecting vehicles, resulting in higher rejection rates.  
            Conversely, those with lower rejection rates are more likely to be conducting improper vehicle inspections; i.e., giving passes to vehicles 
            that should be rejected.  Very high rejection rates could potentially be problematic as well, since they could indicate stations that are 
            falsely rejecting vehicles in order to fraudulently increase repair revenues.  
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            Confounding factors, such as if a station only tests certain makes or model years, may influence the calculated index scores.  
            In general, however, the trigger results provide an easy way to quickly review network-wide performance on the vehicle safety 
            inspection and identify possible problem performers.

            Trigger results are grouped in deciles based on their index scores (0 = 0 to less than 10, 1 = 10 to less than 20, …, 9 = 90 to 100) for ease of presentation.  
            Users can view the decile results in several forms (pie, bar, line, area or splice).  Those deciles that do not contain any results (e.g., decile 3 if 
            no stations had index scores of 30 to less than 40) are not displayed.  
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            Viewing the graphic results in bar chart form allows a user to quickly see the overall distribution of trigger results throughout the network.  
        For example, a bar chart that shows most stations grouped together, at or near the upper (10th) decile or possibly more toward the mid-point of the chart, 
        reflects very good (proper) network performance on that trigger.  The former result (most stations at the top of the chart) would indicate little if any false rejections.  
        One with most stations grouped more in the middle of the chart but with one or more stations at the 10th decile might mean that those stations with the highest 
        index scores are involved in falsely rejecting vehicles to increase repair revenues.  
        </span><span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            On the other hand, these same latter results (most stations in the middle of the chart) could also mean that only a few stations—those with the 
            highest index scores—are actually performing proper vehicle safety inspections and rejections.  In all cases, those with the lowest index scores 
            would be considered suspect performers if they are rejecting significantly fewer vehicles on average than the other stations.

            Given this range of possible findings, it is important to review the underlying data (e.g., actual station rejection rates) to gain additional 
            insight into any displayed trigger results that appear to be of concern.  To do this, users can click on the individual bars on the bar chart 
            to see a listing of trigger results for each of the stations making up that bar.  This brings up a table that shows the underlying data (e.g., total test count, 
            number of passes and rejections, rejection rate) for each station.  The table contents can be sorted by any of the column headings by clicking on that heading.

            Because of the small number of stations in some of the deciles, it may not be possible to click on those bars to bring up the list of stations.  
            Users can instead display the results in pie chart form and click on the either the applicable slice or the title of the slice.  
            This allows a user to bring up the station results for all deciles displayed in the charts.
